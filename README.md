# Master Gatsby

The application is a template that can be used by a restaurant. A full-stack SPA that utilizes webhooks to update data in real-time and serverless functions to process orders. Slick's Slices can be redesigned for any restaurant and can easily be integrated with a POS to accept orders. The application is fully optimized for mobile and includes common SEO features.

## Features

A menu that spans two pages. The drinks are pulled from an API and the pizzas/slicemasters are pulled from Sanity. Users that are currently working can be added or removed using sanity and the home page will change.
